BPMN 2.0 Compatible XML Builder/Generator using GenAI, React JS + Node JS
- Use case: A user can easily engage Gen AI to produce initial draft of a workflow and edit the workflow to fit their needs to produce final BPMN 2.0 compatible XML. then use this XML in your workflow orchestrator engine of your choice (jBPM, Camuda, etc.).
- React + Node JS + Express + REST APIs + Open AI or Google Gemini Prompt Engineering + BPMN JS & MODDLER + Api-Gateway along with other required dependency libraries
- A User can enter in business/natural language on what workflow they needed. With Prompt request enhanced, the process first produces Workflow JSON and then converts the same to BPMN 2.0 compatible XML & displays diagram (for visual representation).
- A user can choose which AI model (for now supports openAI and gemini) to consume and whether or not a BPMN xml file to be written to project structure.
